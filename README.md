# Network Security - DNS-SPOOF and firewalls

This is a the final exercise of the Network Security course. 

In this project i:

 1. Create a private network, demilitarized network, a router, and a public network via Virtualbox.
 2. Generate a firewall by writing specific iptables rules for the router.
 3. Build Apache HTTP servers.
 4. Use Squid proxy to allow the private network to browse the web through the demilitarized network and block certain content on websites.
 5. Use Snort as an IDS and IPS to alert or reject packets.
 6. Use Nmap to scan the victim's network.
 7. Develop a script with Scapy to modify a packet while performing a DNS-SPOOF attack by the router (MITM).
